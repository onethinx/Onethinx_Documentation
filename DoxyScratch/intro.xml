<entry thead="no"><para>Onethinx LoRaWAN module is a purpose-built module for engineers and companies that want to get into the LoRa and LoRaWAN space, design their own product or more easily design products for their clients, but do not want to spend their time developing the LoRaWAN stack, hardware, RF, matching network, LoRa antenna, deal with security and certifications, etc. Onethinx module, with its dual ARM Cortex M0+ and M4 core offers an unpresidented amount of security, ease of use and reliability. It utilizes PSoC6s&apos; ARM Cortex M0+ core to securely store and lock our unique, and easy to use LoRa/LoRaWAN stack, while it allows you to use the full ARM Cortex M4 core for your application, without worry that it will negatively influence the operation of the LoRa/LoRaWAN stack. The PSoC 6 microcontroller also integrates the (in silicon) Embedded Secure Element and Hardware Crypto Engine which expands its security capabilities without compromising ease of use (unlinke modules that utilize external secure elements or none at all), because the security is handeled automatically by the stack.</para>
<para>Furthermore, Onethinx module uses the latest and best in class Semtech SX1261 LoRa radio chip for the EU 868 MHz and SX1262 LoRa radio chip for US 915 MHz and AU 923 MHz module versions. The newest generation of Semtech SX126X radio chips improoves power efficiency while also adding several additional features like SF5, higher output power, smaller chips size, lower power consumption, etc. Onethinx module matching network and integrated high-efficiency omnidirectional antenna are specially designed and matched for the region they are used in, while keeping everything in a small thumb-sized package measuring only 24.5 mm x 20 mm (incl. antenna). This allows you, not only to integrate the Onethinx LoRaWAN module in small sized applications, but also allows you not to be an RF matching and RF design expert in order to use our all-integrated LoRaWAN module.</para>
<para>Onethinx LoRaWAN module also allows you to use the onboard Bluetooth 5 (external antenna). The availability of Bluetooth on the module has prooven most useful for Firmware Over The Air updates. It allows the end user to use a smartphone with an application to upload the latest revision of your M4 application to the module. Using the end users phone to perform the Bluetooth FOTA has prooven to be most viable option for all our clients due to the wide use of smartphones.</para>
<para>Onethinx easy-to-use LoRaWAN API consists of several easy-to-use functions. These functions are called from the Cortex M4 core, where the users application resides, and they communicate the necessary information to the Cortex M0+ core, where the LoRa/LoRaWAN stack resides. The two cores communicate using Inter Processor Communication (IPC). This is all handeled in the background when user calls the functions, which additionaly eases the development.</para>
